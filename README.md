# An Arduino Lightsaber

This is code for a lightsaber constructed from an 
[Adafruit M4 Feather Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) and
a [Adafruit Propmaker Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988)

The code was inspired by the CircuitPython lightsaber code found 
[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/hallowing-lightsaber?view=all) for the 
Adafruit HaloWing.
